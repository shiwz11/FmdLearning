The central and unfinished task of absolute asset pricing is to understand and measure the souce of aggregate or macroeconomic risk that drive asset prices.

This book advocates a discount factor/generalalized method of moments view of asset pricing theory and associated empirical procedures. The author summarizes asset pricing by two equations:

$$
\begin{aligned}
p_t &= E(m_{t+1} x_{t+1}) \\
m_{t+1} &= f(data, parameters)
\end{aligned}
$$

$p_t$: asset price;

$x_{t+1}$: asset payoff;

$m_{t+1}$: stochastic discount factor

# Consumption-Based Model and Overview

## Basic Pricing Equation

A investor's first-order conditions give the basic consumption-based model.

$$
p_t = E_t\left[\beta\frac{u^{\prime}(c_{t+1})}{u^{\prime}(c_{t})}x_{t+1} \right] 
$$

We model investors by a *utility function* defined over current and future values of consumption.

$$
U(c_t, c_{t+1}) = u(c_t) + \beta E_t[u(c_{t+1})]
$$

We often use a convenient power utility form:

$$
u(c_t) = \frac{1}{1-\gamma}c_{t}^{1-\gamma}
$$

The limit as $\gamma \rightarrow 1$ is:

$$
u(c) = ln(c)
$$


$$
\max _{\{\xi\}} u\left(c_t\right)+E_t\left[\beta u\left(c_{t+1}\right)\right] \quad s.t. 
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
c_t &=e_t-p_t \xi \\
c_{t+1} &=e_{t+1}+x_{t+1} \xi
\end{aligned}
$$

Substituting the constraints into the objective, and setting the derivative with respect to $\xi$ equal to zero, we obtain the first-order condition for an optimal consumption and portfolio choice:

$$
p_tu^{\prime}(c_t) = E_t[\beta u^{\prime}(c_{t+1})x_{t+1}]
$$

or

$$
p_t = E_t\left[\beta \frac{u^{\prime}(c_{t+1})}{u^{\prime}(c_{t})}x_{t+1} \right]
$$

## Marginal Rate of Substitution/Stochastic Discount Factor

Berak up the basic consumption-based pricing equation into:


\begin{aligned}
p &= E(mx)\\

m &= \beta\frac{u^{\prime}(c_{t+1})}{u^{\prime}(c_{t})}
\end{aligned}

The price always comes at t, the payoff at t+1, and the expections is conditional on time-t information.

If there is no uncertainty, we can express prices via the standard present value formula:

$$
p_t = \frac{1}{R^f}x_{x+1}
$$

$$
m_{t+1} \equiv \beta \frac{u^{\prime}(c_{t+1})}{u^{\prime}(c_t)}
$$


$$
p_t = E_t(m_{t+1}x_{t+1})
$$

## Prices, Payoffs, and Notation

$$
x_{t+1} = \left(1 + \frac{p_{t+1}}{d_{t+1}} \right)\frac{d_{t+1}}{d_{t}}
$$

## Classic Issues in Finance

**Risk Free Rate**

The risk-free rate is related to the discount factor by:

$$
R^f = 1/E(m)
$$

With **lognormal** consumption growth and **power** utility

$$
r_t^f=\delta+\gamma E_t\left(\Delta \ln c_{t+1}\right)-\frac{\gamma^2}{2} \sigma_t^2\left(\Delta \ln c_{t+1}\right)  \qquad (1.7)
$$

> Real interest rates are high when people are impatient ($\delta$), when expected consumption growth is high (intertemporal substitution), or when risk is low (precautionary saving). A more curved utility function ($\gamma$) or a lower elasticity of intertemporal substitution ($1/\gamma$) means that interest rates are more sensitive to changes in expected consumption growth.


**Risk Corrections**

Payoffs that are positively correlated with consumption growth have lower prices, to compensate investors for risk.

$$
\begin{aligned}
p &= \frac{E(x)}{R^f} + cov(m,x) \\
E(R^i) - R^f &= -R^f cov(m, R^i)
\end{aligned}
$$

Expected returns are proportional to the covariance of returns with discount factors.
